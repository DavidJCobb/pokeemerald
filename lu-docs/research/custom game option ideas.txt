== Custom Game Options ==

When you start a new playthrough, you should be able to configure a wide variety of Custom Game options. 
You'll initially be presented with three presets:

 - Enhanced
    = All optional QOL changes are enabled.

 - Vanilla
    = All optional QOL changes are disabled.

 - Nuzlocke
    = All optional QOL changes are enabled, except for any that may make the game easier (e.g. faster 
      overworld running speed, which could help you dodge spinners). The following Nuzlocke settings 
      are also activated:
      
       - Nuzlocke: Enabled
       - Slain Pokemon Behavior: Graveyard
       - Encounter Limit: Enabled
          - Gift Pokemon: Counts as Encounter
          - Shiny Exception: Always Allow
          - Dupes Clause: Enabled
             - Shiny Exception: Always Allow

 - Custom Game
    = Brings you to the full Custom Game options menu, with all options set to their "Enhanced" values; 
      there, you can configure absolutely anything before starting your playthrough.


I want to offer a ton of options, which means a ton of values to store in flash memory. Some basic 
principles:

 - **Data should be bitpacked.** If we don't need a whole byte, then don't use a whole byte. We can read 
   data in and out of RAM and convert between CPU-efficient and storage-efficient formats as needed.
   
 - **Avoid the use of presence bits.** My experience with bitpacked data comes from Halo: Reach, which 
   used "presence bits" for pieces of data that could be conditionally omitted from UGC. However, in our 
   case, we're packing data into a small storage space, and it needs to be possible to store every data 
   field and every combination of data values. As such, we gain nothing from presence bits, and using 
   them will only expose us to potential mistakes wherein we test smaller combinations of data and miss 
   when larger combinations of data can't fit in the allotted space.
   
 - **Data should be versioned.** Data should be prefixed with a 32-bit version number (non-semver). If 
   at all possible, however, I'd like to avoid having an upgrade procedure in the ROM itself, as that'll 
   lead to more and more seldom-used code going forward. Instead, I want to look into the possibility of 
   save data transplantation: most emulators, including MyBoy! on Android, will let you export just the 
   128KB flash memory as a *.sav file, so we can theoretically load that and do some surgery on it.


=== Value types and storage formats ===

 - Species ID: 11 bits; range [0, 2047]
 - Percentage scale, unsigned, wide:
    - [0, 5000] with  1% granularity would be 13 bits
    - [0, 5000] with 10% granularity would be  9 bits

=== Desired ===

 = Union: starting species
    - Override all three starter Pokemon
       - Cost: 3 uint16_ts
    - Single-species challenge
       - Cost:
          - uint16_t: player species
          - uint16_t: rival base species (we evolve it for later battles)
          - 2-bit enum:
             - Only allow catching target species
             - Polymorph all caught Pokemon into target species
             - Grant instance of target species after each Gym Badge, up to 6
          = Total: 34 bits

 = Scaling
    - Battle values for both player and enemy
       - Accuracy
       - Damage dealt
       - Move side-effect odds
    - Wild encounter rates
    - Catch rates
    - Egg lay time
    - Egg hatch time
    - Mirage Island odds
       = Mirage Island works by testing whether the low 16 bits of any party Pokemon's personality 
         value match the current Mirage Island random value. This means we can scale Mirage Island 
         "odds" in 15 increments at the most granular, not including "never" and "always" options.
    - Money loss on defeat
       - Percentage modifier
       - Clamp to minimum
       - Clamp to maximum
    - Money gain on victory
       - Percentage modifier
       - Clamp to minimum
       - Clamp to maximum
    - Shop prices, buy
    - Shop prices, sell
    - Sprinting speed
    - Overworld poison damage rates
       - Steps taken
       - Damage dealt
    - Levels
       - Player starter initial level
       - Min, max, and multiplier by subject
          - Wild Pokemon
          - Rival
          - Enemy trainer
          - Ally trainer
       - Bool: Force evolution to match levels?
 
 = Various
    - Allow editing options after starting the playthrough
       = Disabled by default. Intended for Let's Players and other content creators who may 
         need to adjust things on the fly.
       = Actually, instead of going this far, maybe just track when the player changes any 
         custom game options and remember the fact of them having done that. We can display 
         the fact of changes occurring or not when entering the player into the Hall of Fame, 
         and this can guard challenge runs.
    - Start game with Running Shoes
    - Swap trade evolutions for stone or level evolutions
       - Cost: 2-bit enum
          = Disabled
          = Stones
          = Level Ups
    - Enable/disable full Pokedex access
       - Enables alternate encounter tables to avoid version-exclusive species
       - Enables additional events for any exclusive legendaries
       - Enables additional events to allow all fossils and starters
          = Needs to ensure all three vanilla starters are catchable if you override starter species
    - Cap player party size
       - Cost: 3-bit value (party cap; 0 = no cap)
    - Cap player party levels
       - ...to furthest-visited route's max wild level
       - ...to highest level in next Gym Leader's party
          = Uses Rival and Champion once all Leaders are defeated
       - ...to constant
    - Limit catches by type(s)
       - Bitfield for types
    - Override player or enemy types
       = i.e. we always act as if your Pokemon are, say, Fire-type
    - Double Battles
       - 4 options; 2 bits.
       - Normal
          = Acts as "Permissive" if you cap your party size at 1. Needed to 
            avoid getting softlocked at Tate & Liza.
       - Permissive
          = You can enter Double Battles even if you only have one Pokemon.
       - Forced
          = All battles are Double Battles. Implies Permissive (otherwise you could literally 
            walk past every trainer if you have just one party member).
       - Disabled
          = All battles are Single Battles.
    - Enable/disable player item use during battles

       = Requires disabling giving TMs to a Pokemon as a held item.
          = What if you receive one in a trade?
       = Requires capping item pickups so you can't get more than one of a TM.
          = What do we replace the item with? Money matching the amount of the TM?
       = What happens if the player changes this option during play?
          = Maybe we grey it out in that case.
    - Enable/disable rebattling fainted/fled legendaries
       = Set fallback locations for Lati@s? Or just make it so it never stops roaming until caught?
    - Enable/disable step counter instead of real-time clock for events (e.g. berries, dailies, etc.)
    - Enable/disable infinite Rare Candies
    - Enable/disable infinite stat vitamins

 = Randomizer
    = Different randomizations should be "volatile" or "static." The former means that they're always
