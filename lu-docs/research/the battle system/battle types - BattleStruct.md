### General


#### `moneyMultiplier`

Used to scale the player's monetary winnings from singleplayer battles. It's initialized to 1 in `BattleStartClearSetData`[^BattleStartClearSetData], and will be set to 2 if the player switches in a Pokemon holding an Amulet Coin.

The Amulet Coin effect is enforced by `ItemBattleEffects` in `battle_util.c`, which executes held item effects in response to specific events.


#### `multiBuffer`

This appears to be a buffer used to transmit link data to other players at the start of the battle. It's a union between a `LinkBattlerHeader` and a `u32 battleVideo[2]`.

The link battler header only contains the following information:

* A little-endian version signature for link communications.
* A little-endian flags-mask for the V.S. screen shown at the start of battle.
* A `BattleEnigmaBerry` instance, presumably used to send the local player's Enigma Berry effects to other players. (Each player has a unique Enigma Berry effect tracked in `gEnigmaBerries`; players aren't forced to use the Link Master's[^dfn-link-master] berry effect.) This is initialized by `SetPlayerBerryDataInBattleStruct()`[^SetPlayerBerryDataInBattleStruct].

The `battleVideo` dwords, meanwhile, are also sent during the start of a multiplayer battle (`CB2_HandleStartMultiBattle` phase 8), being set to `gBattleTypeFlags` and `gRecordedBattleRngSeed`. A code comment in that function claims that the latter value "overwrites berry data" and is undefined behavior. This seems incorrect to me: the two pieces of data are sent at different phases in `CB2_HandleStartMultiBattle`, and as far as I can discern, the Enigma Berry data only overlaps these fields while it's sent, not when it's being received and remembered.


[^dfn-link-master]: <dfn>Link Master</dfn>: In Halo games and on the Xbox platform generally, this would be called the "Party Leader."

[^SetPlayerBerryDataInBattleStruct]: `SetPlayerBerryDataInBattleStruct()` is defined in [`battle_main.c`](/src/battle_main.c).


#### `overworldWeatherDone`

Seemingly intended to track when any weather effect inherited from the overworld has been replaced with a new weather effect triggered in battle. In practice, the functionality doesn't seem complete, and nothing seems to actually do anything with this variable.

This variable is reset to `FALSE` whenever any player is introduced (i.e. sending out Pokemon for the first time in a battle). Then, in `TryDoEventsBeforeFirstTurn` at the start of the battle, if this variable is `FALSE` (which it must be, surely?) and any Pokemon currently on the field has a switch-in effect that triggers a weather condition, then this variable is set to `TRUE`.


#### `scriptPartyIdx`

This is a [battler ID][link-battler-id] used when printing a Pokemon's (nick)name, to tell whether it should be prefixed with "Wild"/"Foe" or not.

The `BattleStringExpandPlaceholders` function (defined in [`src/battle_message.c`](/src/battle_message.c)) takes two arguments, both strings: a source and a destination. It doesn't have access to any of the contextual information that gets passed around by other text-related functions in the battle engine, so it has to rely on global state instead. `gBattleStruct->scriptPartyIndex` is one such piece of global state.


#### `wildVictorySong`

Reset to 0 at the start of the battle by `BattleStartClearSetData`, and then managed by the `getexp` [battle script command](/src/battle_script_commands.c).

The `getexp` command is a [latent function][link-latent-functions]: it relies on a counter (stored in `gBattleScripting.getexpState`) to spread its work across multiple frames. On frame 2, it checks if the current battle is a Wild battle, if [battler ID][link-battler-id] 0 isn't fainted, and if `wildVictorySong` is false. If so, then it calls `BattleStopLowHPSound()`, sets the current background music to `MUS_VICTORY_WILD`, and increments `wildVictorySong` to true.

It shouldn't be possible for `getexp` state 2 to run a second time except in a Double Battle, but Wild Double Battles aren't implemented. If hypothetically they were, then the `wildVictorySong` variable would prevent `getexp` from accidentally restarting the music when you faint the second Wild Pokemon. Someone at Game Freak may have been planning ahead.


#### `wrappedBy`

An array where both the keys and values are [battler IDs][link-battler-id], used to indicate which Pokemon are victims of the move Wrap, and whom their attackers are.

The relationship between key-battler and value-battler is as such: the key-battler is being wrapped by the value-battler. Additionally, the key-battler will have [`STATUS2_WRAPPED`](./battle%20concepts.md#status2).



### State for battle controller handlers
When [battle controllers][link-battle-controller] receive certain [messages](./battle%20controllers.md#messages), they're expected to handle these messages, and are permitted to use [latent][link-latent-functions] functions to do so. If they *do* use a latent function, then they may want or need to store message-related state somewhere. The `gBattleStruct` offers a few such fields, though they're not designed for use by more than one controller at a time.

#### `abilityPreventingSwitchout`
When the local player controller receives [the `CONTROLLER_CHOOSEPOKEMON` message](./battle%20controllers.md#CONTORLLER_CHOOSEPOKEMON), that message is accompanied with data including the abilty (if any) preventing the to-be-switched-out Pokemon from switching out. The controller copies that ability to `gBattleStruct->abilityPreventingSwitchout`, where it can then be read by `SetMonPreventsSwitchingString()` in [`pokemon.c`](/src/pokemon.c) to build the appropriate player-facing error message.

#### `battlerPreventingSwitchout`
When the local player controller receives [the `CONTROLLER_CHOOSEPOKEMON` message](./battle%20controllers.md#CONTORLLER_CHOOSEPOKEMON), that message is accompanied with data including the [ID][link-battler-id] of a battler (if there is one) preventing the player from switching their current Pokemon out. The controller copies that battler ID to `gBattleStruct->battlerPreventingSwitchout`, where it can then be read by `SetMonPreventsSwitchingString()` in [`pokemon.c`](/src/pokemon.c) to build the appropriate player-facing error message.

This field isn't actually what *prevents* a switchout; that's handled by other message data, copied to other places.

#### `prevSelectedPartySlot`
When the local player controller receives [the `CONTROLLER_CHOOSEPOKEMON` message](./battle%20controllers.md#CONTORLLER_CHOOSEPOKEMON), that message is accompanied with data including the party slot that the to-be-switched-out Pokemon is in. The controller copies that slot to `gBattleStruct->prevSelectedPartySlot`, where the party menu can then use it to prevent the player from switching a Pokemon out for itself.


### State for latent functions

#### `atkCancellerTracker`

The term "attack canceller" seems to have been chosen for the various factors that can cancel the use of a move, such as being asleep, or being subject to the effects of the Truant ability.

The `atkCancellerTracker` value is set to zero when a battler attempts to use a move (`HandleAction_UseMove` in `battle_util.c`), and then used as a loop index (where one would typically use a local variable instead) within `AtkCanceller_UnableToUseMove`, which checks whether any of the cancel conditions are met and if so, executes them. The latter function is called by the latent `attackcanceler` script command.

#### `formToChangeInto`

A castform form value (`CASTFORM_`) as defined in [`constants/battle.h`](/include/constants/battle.h), potentially OR'd with `CASTFORM_SUBSTITUTE`.

The value is first set up in `AbilityBattleEffects` (in [`battle_util.c`](/src/battle_util.c)) by the handlers for the Forecast and Air Lock abilities, which also queue the `BattleScript_CastformChange` battle script to run. Then, the `docastformchangeanimation` [battle script command](/src/battle_script_commands.c) adds the Substitute flag if necessary, and passes the value as an argument to `BtlController_EmitBattleAnimation`.

In short: this variable is only here so it can be briefly juggled across different execution contexts.

#### `switchInAbilitiesCounter`
A loop counter in the range \[0, `gBattlersCount`\) used by the latent `TryDoEventsBeforeFirstTurn` function in [`battle_main.c`](/src/battle_main.c). This loops over all active battlers in order from fastest to slowest, and checks their switch-in ability effects at the start of a battle.

#### `turnEffectsTracker` and `turnEffectsBattlerId`
<a name="turnEffectsTracker"></a><a name="turnEffectsBattlerId"></a>

These variables appear to only be used in a single place: they're both used as loop counters inside of `DoBattlerEndTurnEffects` in [`battle_util.c`](/src/battle_util.c), and aren't read from anywhere else.

`DoBattlerEndTurnEffects` is a latent function, as is its caller, `BattleTurnPassed`. Multiple effects may end up activating at the end of a single turn. If an effect activates, then `DoBattlerEndTurnEffects` returns early &mdash; interrupting its internal loops &mdash; and `BattleTurnPassed` then also returns. The functions are called on the next frame, and the loop continues where it left off. Only after `DoBattlerEndTurnEffects` runs to completion &mdash; only after all potential turn effects are processed &mdash; does overall execution continue.

The `DoBattlerEndTurnEffects` function is a nested loop organized roughly like the following (with a couple imaginary macros used for brevity and exposition):

```c
while (gBattleStruct->turnEffectsBattlerId < gBattlersCount && gBattleStruct->turnEffectsTracker <= ENDTURN_BATTLER_COUNT) {
   u8 effect;
   
   gActiveBattler = gBattlerAttacker = gBattlerByTurnOrder[gBattleStruct->turnEffectsBattlerId];
   
   if (BATTLER_IS_ABSENT(gActiveBattler)) {
      gBattleStruct->turnEffectsBattlerId++;
      continue;
   }
   
   switch (gBattleStruct->turnEffectsTracker) {
      case ENDTURN_WHATEVER:
         if (EFFECT_IS_RELEVANT()) {
            effect = 1;
         }
         ++gBattleStruct->turnEffectsTracker;
         break;
         
      case ENDTURN_BATTLER_COUNT:  // done
         gBattleStruct->turnEffectsTracker = 0;
         gBattleStruct->turnEffectsBattlerId++;
         break;
   }
   
   if (effect)
      return effect;
}
gHitMarker &= ~(HITMARKER_GRUDGE | HITMARKER_IGNORE_BIDE);
return 0;
```
