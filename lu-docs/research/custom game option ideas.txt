== Custom Game Options ==

=== Value types and storage formats ===

 - Species ID: 11 bits; range [0, 2047]
 - Percentage scale, unsigned, wide:
    - [0, 5000] with  1% granularity would be 13 bits
    - [0, 5000] with 10% granularity would be  9 bits

=== Desired ===

 = Union: starting species
    - Override all three starter Pokemon
       - Cost: 3 uint16_ts
    - Single-species challenge
       - Cost:
          - uint16_t: player species
          - uint16_t: rival base species (we evolve it for later battles)
          - 2-bit enum:
             - Only allow catching target species
             - Polymorph all caught Pokemon into target species
             - Grant instance of target species after each Gym Badge, up to 6
          = Total: 34 bits

 = Scaling
    - Battle values for both player and enemy
       - Accuracy
       - Damage dealt
       - Move side-effect odds
    - Wild encounter rates
    - Catch rates
    - Egg lay time
    - Egg hatch time
    - Mirage Island odds
       = Mirage Island works by testing whether the low 16 bits of any party Pokemon's personality 
         value match the current Mirage Island random value. This means we can scale Mirage Island 
         "odds" in 15 increments at the most granular, not including "never" and "always" options.
